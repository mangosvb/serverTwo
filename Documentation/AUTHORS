This file contains the authors of the MaNGOS project.

The project is currently hosted at http://www.getmangos.co.uk

The code of MaNGOS is shipped as it is without any form of warranty,
and - except for third party libraries - licensed under the GPL 2.0,
which you can read from the file "COPYING"

Development of this project dates back to 2008, and was developed by the Spurious Team but has
been a dead project for several years:
* getMaNGOS, 2013 onwards, located at http://www.getmangos.co.uk and http://www.getmangos.com

Additional input from other teams is acknowledged in the THANKS file.

Authorship is assigned for each commit within the git history, which is stored in these git repositories:
* github.com/mangosvb/serverOne (History since then)

The third party libraries have their own way of addressing authorship, and the authorship of commits importing/ updating
a third party library reflects who did the importing instead of who wrote the code within the commit.

These are the authors that contributed to the files available within this package since 2005.
The Authors of third party libraries are not explicitly mentioned, and usually are possible to obtain from the files belonging to the third party libraries.

Please inform us, if you find somebody who is missing!
